# BetterShift

### Overview
Our community is continually growing, all based around one common goal: to ensure your voice is heard. BetterShift is a community platform where employees in hospitality are able to post reviews of their place of work. In turn, this showcases a more accurate description of what it is actually like to work in a potential establishment, before setting your foot in the door.

If someone is interested in a particular place of employment, with BetterShift, they are now able to see how much money they can  make based on their job title, what benefits are on the table, or how future management / frequent guests might treat them. 

With this type of platform, we are empowering prospective employees with the knowledge on whether an establishment would be an ideal work environment. Here at BetterShift we believe this is an often overlooked part of the industry, and is the first step in giving control back to our people.
